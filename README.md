#Social Gaming Network

The purpose of this project is to provide gamers with a platform where they can see the games that their friends are playing and see what their friends think about the games they are playing. This app gives players the ability to create, update, and read their own reviews of games. It also allows players to see the games that their friends are playing and the reviews that their friends have written.

#Motivation

This project was assigned by Flatiron School. This project was motivated by finding a way to bond with their friends over games, get opinions on games from people they know, and get ideas for what games they may want to play next. Ultimately, this program allows people to discover new games while enhancing a gamer's social network.

When creating a new game, you will be prompted to enter the gameâ€™s name, genre, and the platforms on which it is available. Once you have created your game, you will be returned to the main menu.

When creating a new review for a game, the program will prompt you for the game you would like to review, your thoughts on the game, and a rating between 1 and 10 for the game. When your review has been created, you will be given the option to either see all of your reviews or return to the main menu.

When finding a review for a particular game, the program will prompt you to enter the name of the game for which you want to see a review. It will show you the review for the game and then give you options to update the review, delete the review, or return to the main menu.
